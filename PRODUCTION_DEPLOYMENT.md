# Production Deployment Guide

## Current Status: Development Keys Fixed ✅

**The Clerk warning has been resolved by:**
1. ✅ Updated environment variables to use new format
2. ✅ Replaced deprecated `AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL` with `FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL`
3. ✅ ClerkProvider now uses environment variables properly

## Important: Development vs Production Keys

### Development Keys (Current - SAFE for local development)
- **Publishable Key**: `pk_test_*` (currently in use)
- **Secret Key**: `sk_test_*` (currently in use)
- **Status**: ✅ Working correctly for development

### When to Switch to Production Keys

You only need production keys when:
- Deploying to a live website/domain
- Users other than you will access the application
- You want to remove usage limitations

## Step-by-Step Production Setup

### 1. Create Production Instance in Clerk Dashboard

1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://clerk.com/dashboard)
2. Click the "Development" dropdown at the top
3. Select "Create production instance"
4. Choose to clone your development settings or start fresh

### 2. Get Production Keys

After creating your production instance:
1. Copy your **Production Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_live_`)
2. Copy your **Production Secret Key** (starts with `sk_live_`)

### 3. Update Environment Variables for Production

For **local testing with production keys**, update `.env.local`:

```bash
# Clerk Authentication - PRODUCTION KEYS
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_actual_production_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_actual_production_secret_here

# Clerk URLs (using new redirect URL format)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard

# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_production_database_url_here
```

### 4. Deploy to Hosting Platform

Add these environment variables to your hosting platform:

#### For Vercel:
```bash
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
vercel env add CLERK_SECRET_KEY
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL
vercel env add DATABASE_URL
```

#### For Netlify, Railway, or other platforms:
Add the same environment variables through their dashboard or CLI.

## Important Security Notes

1. **Never commit production keys to Git**
2. **Keep development and production keys separate**
3. **Use environment variables for all sensitive data**

## Current Setup (Development)

Your current setup is **perfectly fine for development**:
- ✅ Using development keys (`pk_test_*` and `sk_test_*`)
- ✅ No deprecated environment variables
- ✅ Proper fallback redirect URLs configured

## When You're Ready for Production

1. **Create production instance** in Clerk Dashboard
2. **Update environment variables** with production keys
3. **Deploy to your hosting platform**
4. **Configure your custom domain** in Clerk Dashboard
5. **Set up OAuth providers** for production (if using social login)

The development keys warning will automatically disappear once you switch to production keys (`pk_live_*` and `sk_live_*`).

## For Now (Development)

You can safely ignore the development keys warning - it's working exactly as intended for local development!
