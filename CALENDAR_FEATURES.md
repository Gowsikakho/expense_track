# Calendar-Based Expense Tracker Features

## Overview
The expense tracker now includes an enhanced calendar interface with the following features:

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Expandable Date Boxes
- **Click Behavior**: Clicking on any date in the calendar expands that date's box to show detailed expense information
- **Single Expansion**: Only one date can be expanded at a time - clicking another date collapses the previous one
- **Visual Feedback**: Expanded dates span the full width of the calendar and have enhanced styling

### 2. Expense Form (Moved Outside Calendar)
- **Location**: The expense form is now positioned above the calendar for better accessibility
- **Default Date**: All new expenses are automatically added to today's date
- **Form Fields**:
  - **Expense Name**: Required field for expense description
  - **Amount**: Required numeric field for expense amount
  - **Category**: Optional dropdown with predefined categories (Food, Transport, Entertainment, etc.)
  - **Notes**: Optional text field for additional information

### 3. Date-Specific Expense Display
- **Expense List**: When a date is clicked, all expenses for that specific date are displayed
- **Scrollable Container**: Long lists of expenses are contained in a scrollable area
- **Empty State**: Shows "No expenses on this date" message when no expenses exist
- **Expense Details**: Each expense shows name, amount, and notes (if available)

### 4. Data Structure
- **Date Grouping**: Expenses are grouped by date for efficient filtering and display
- **Real-time Updates**: Calendar automatically refreshes when new expenses are added
- **Database Integration**: All data is stored in PostgreSQL with proper schema

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Added notes column to expenses table
ALTER TABLE "expenses" ADD COLUMN "notes" varchar;
```

### State Management
- Uses React's `useState` for local state management
- `expandedDate`: Tracks which date is currently expanded
- `dailyExpenses`: Groups expenses by date for efficient rendering
- `isAddingExpense`: Loading state for expense creation

### Key Functions
- `handleDateClick()`: Manages date expansion/collapse logic
- `handleAddExpense()`: Creates new expenses with today's date
- `getDayExpenses()`: Retrieves expenses for a specific date
- `fetchMonthExpenses()`: Loads all expenses for the current month

## Usage Instructions

1. **Adding Expenses**:
   - Fill out the form above the calendar
   - Click "Add Expense" to save to today's date
   - The calendar will automatically update

2. **Viewing Expenses**:
   - Click on any date in the calendar
   - The date box will expand to show all expenses for that date
   - Click another date to view different expenses

3. **Navigation**:
   - Use the arrow buttons to navigate between months
   - Today's date is highlighted in the calendar

## UI/UX Improvements

- **Responsive Design**: Form adapts to different screen sizes
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear separation between form and calendar
- **Loading States**: Button shows loading state during expense creation
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for success/error states
- **Accessibility**: Proper labels and keyboard navigation support

## Future Enhancements

- Expense editing/deletion
- Export functionality

- Recurring expense support
