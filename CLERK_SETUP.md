# Clerk Authentication Setup

## Current Status
✅ **Fixed Issues:**
- Replaced deprecated `afterSignOutUrl` with `fallbackRedirectUrl` in dashboard.tsx
- Updated all Image components with `priority` prop for LCP optimization
- All auth pages properly configured with `fallbackRedirectUrl="/dashboard"`
- Added explicit redirect URLs to ClerkProvider to override deprecated defaults
- Removed console.log from dashboard layout for cleaner output

## Development Keys Warning

You're currently seeing this warning:
```
Clerk: Clerk has been loaded with development keys. Development instances have strict usage limits and should not be used when deploying your application to production.
```

**This is NORMAL for development!** This warning appears because you're using development keys (pk_test_* and sk_test_*), which is correct for local development.

## Environment Setup

1. **For Development (Current):** 
   - You're using development keys, which is correct
   - The warning is just informational

2. **For Production Deployment:**
   - You'll need to create a production instance in Clerk Dashboard
   - Replace development keys with production keys (pk_live_* and sk_live_*)
   - Update your environment variables

## Environment Variables Template

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and add your actual Clerk keys:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` with your actual keys from https://clerk.com/dashboard

## What's Already Fixed

1. ✅ **Deprecated Props**: Replaced `afterSignOutUrl` with `fallbackRedirectUrl`
2. ✅ **Image Optimization**: Added `priority` prop to all above-the-fold images
3. ✅ **Performance**: Optimized LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) metrics

## Next Steps for Production

When you're ready to deploy:

1. Create a production instance in Clerk Dashboard
2. Update environment variables with production keys
3. Configure your domain and OAuth providers for production
4. The development key warning will automatically disappear

For now, you can safely ignore the development keys warning - it's working as intended!
